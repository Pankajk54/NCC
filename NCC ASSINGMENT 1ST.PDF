1.EXAMPLE OF PROPAGANDA COMMUNICATION
This poster was created by British illustrator Savile Lumley and was used in World War I to compel men with families to enlist. The aim of the poster was to strike at their pride, persuading them that in the future their children would judge them not for their decision to support their family back home, but for their wartime contribution  
 









2. EXAMPLE OF TWO STEP FLOW STRATGEY

In the first step, a mass-media message is sent to those who pay close attention to it. These avid media audiences are the opinion leaders. They receive the media's messages about the topic. But, like all communication, the messages from the mass media are open to multiple interpretations, and the opinion leaders form their own judgments about the information the media provides.

In the second step, the opinion leaders spread their own interpretations of the media content to those around them - friends, family, co-workers, and anyone else willing to listen. While the original theory (formulated in 1944) talked mostly about word-of-mouth conversations between opinion leaders and other members of the public, today these conversations can also happen among friends and followers on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These opinion leaders then use their own personal influence to try to sway those around them to their interpretation of the broadcast. The opinion leaders tend to have influence among those they try to persuade, because they communicate on a personal level with others, and because people tend to be friends with those who are similar to them.
 




3.EXAMPLE OF COMMUNICATION TARGETING YOUNG MEN 


 Gillette – tradition
Of the three brands, Gillette illustrates the most traditional approach. It builds a powerful, masculine image, employs strong, authoritative language and in its communication portrays men who embody a classic, alpha male persona.

Gillette’s biggest strength lies in the fact that its brand strategy has been the same for decades and its branding has always been consistent (e.g., the tagline, “The Best a Man can Get” is one of the best recognized corporate slogans in the world and has been in use for more than 30 years).

At a functional level, Gillette stands for the highest quality, precision and innovation. This rational messaging is translated into an emotional benefit defined as “helping men look, feel and be their best every day”.

In 2019, for the first time in its history, Gillette launched a campaign which wasn’t focused on the quality or technological advancements of its products and had an entirely different tone than the brand’s previous communications. The advert called “The Best Men Can Be” was Gillette’s attempt to run a purpose-driven initiative designed to reduce so called “toxic masculinity”. Its objective was to remind men how important it is to not use “boys will be boys” type of excuses and to instead, hold other men accountable. The campaign proved highly controversial. On the one hand, it went viral and gave Gillette unprecedented media exposure. On the other hand, however, some of the brand’s target audience found it offensive as it felt accusatory rather than empowering.
 





4.EXAMPLE OF TAGETING YOUNG WOMEN

#LikeAGirl is a campaign that needs no introduction. Originally launched in 2014, the multi award-winning marketing effort successfully positioned Always as an ambassador for female empowerment and social change. In 2017, the campaign’s message was adjusted to encourage girls to embrace failure and learn from it, rather than be discouraged by it.

The Insight
At puberty, 49% of girls feel paralyzed by the fear of failure, leading them to avoid trying new things. This insight sparked an idea that allowed the brand to expand on its original message, empowering girls to tackle this fear and ‘keep going #LikeAGirl’.

Why it Worked
This long-running campaign continues to break barriers and challenge social perceptions, all the while evolving its empowering message. Its success is primarily due to its insight-driven approach that puts perceptions at the forefront – and with 70% of women and 60% of men saying the original campaign changed their perception of the phrase ‘like a girl’ for the better, it’s clearly a tactic that pays.
 


5.EXAMPLE OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMUNICATIONS

Google fights against Ebola
While governments around the world were unsuccessfully trying to make up their minds about the best approach, sitting around and debating and discussing the best ways to combat Ebola…Google stepped up to the plate. In November, its CEO announced it would pledge $2 for every dollar donated through its website. They set up a specific URL onetoday.google.com/fightebola to explain this original social action and invite people across the globe to contribute to this worthwhile, timely cause. When you type “Google Ebola campaign” into a search engine, you’ll get over 22 million results with posts, news, articles and mentions of this initiative which made governments from all over the world feel ashamed as a result of their indecisiveness about how to best face this challenge.
